This article sums up why and how I run Arch Linux on
[my Framework Laptop 13](/blog/why-i-am-getting-a-framework/), which I received
on the 3rd of July 2023, and am still as of today happily using!

I'm *extremely* impressed and very happy with this laptop - it is by far one of
the best devices I've owned in a long time. It is near-silent, It uses ~5watts
at idle, it's fast, it's sturdy and it looks good!

This is going to be quite a long article, so here's a Table of Contents:

* TOC

## Why Arch Linux

Prior to my Framework Laptop adventures, I've been planning to move to Arch
Linux for a while. I'm a long-time Linux desktop user. I started out with those
Red Hat CD-ROMs you'd buy at your local bookshop (this was around '96). I
fooled around with SCO UnixWare, had a whole period of SGI IRIX after that and
then some distro-hopping to Debian, Fedora, Arch Linux (in 2006), Gentoo and
Void Linux, more-or-less in that order.

The last two-ish years I've been running on Void Linux, which I still strongly
recommend and love - it's a really good distribution with a nice balance between
stability and simplicity.

I used the OS package manager for the essentials, like Gnome, Firefox, the
terminal, Wayland and X11, and used `/opt` like a sort of `Program Files` or
`Applications` directory where I had my own programs like IntelliJ, Postman,
PostgreSQL, etc.

This works relatively well: you don't have a lot of demands on package
availability in the distro itself and you keep things stable - only update your
own stuff when you feel like it and/or when you need to.

At a certain point I had about 70 applications in `/opt` which became a burden
to keep up to date, so I set out to find a distribution that packages as much
as possible of the software I use, and where packaging it yourself is as simple
as possible.

I definitely prefer a rolling-release distro. I checked out Nix, Gentoo and Arch
Linux. Nix I found really appealing (hard declarative) but I hated the syntax
(maybe Guix one day? I like Scheme better).

Gentoo did have a comparable set of packaged software available, and it *is*
one of my favorite distributions, but I had too many issues on my test-build
virtual machine which blocked me from experimenting prior to running it on my
daily driver.

So why move to Arch? Well, in one word: mind-share. The wiki, the amount of
packaged software, sane package standards:

  * The Arch wiki has essentially become the de-facto standard Linux wiki
  * Really huge package collection, fantastic community participation with AUR
  * Upstream stable usually means an upstream update is in repos within minutes
  * Does not have separate dev/devel packages for headers

The above three things means a lot of convenience to a Linux desktop user. On
Arch Linux, 99.9% of the software I ever used on Linux is packaged, most of it
in the official repositories and a few in AUR. Next to that, AUR and PKGBUILD
are so easy to get into, so you can easily package things yourself and share it
with the community.

On most other distros the gap between what's packaged and what isn't is quite
a bit larger which means you need alternative ways to get that software and keep
it up-to-date, which in practice becomes error-prone and time-consuming.

On Arch Linux I made the choice to run *everything* packaged with `pacman`. If
I need something that isn't packaged yet (currently the case for 5 packages of
which I packaged one already), I package it and publish it to AUR.

The rest of this article is essentially a how-to with notes about what I run
and install. Feel free to peruse and/or replay!

## BIOS settings

You can find the [BIOS guide](https://community.frame.work/t/bios-guide/4178)
on the Framework community website. The only settings I changed were:

  * CPU Configuration -> Boot Performance mode: **MAX BATTERY**
  * CPU Configuration -> Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0: **DISABLED**
  * Secure Boot -> Enforce Secure Boot: **DISABLED**

The above causes the laptop to effectively run in a lower TDP setting. I think
it goes from 28watts to 22watts. This has a dramatic effect on the battery life
and thermals of the device. I don't want a wild beast that blasts the fans as
soon as I type `ls`, so these settings are great for me. Did I mention the
laptop performs really great with these settings?

With the above and the settings I configure in TLP I get ~3watts idle with
screen on normal brightness, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled, and about ~45 celsius
core temperatures.

## Basic installation

Basically, [download](https://archlinux.org/download/) the ISO and follow the
[installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide). I
opted to use `systemd-boot` as boot manager and `systemd-networkd` as my network
configuration tooling.

### Additional kernel parameters I use

Whichever boot manager you use, you might want to set a few extra kernel
parameters. I found the following additionals handle a bunch of stuff nicely
on my Framework Laptop 13:

```
net.ifnames=0 libata.allow_tpm=1 module_blacklist=cros_ec_lpcs,hid_sensor_hub acpi_osi="!Windows 2020" tpm_tis.interrupts=0 nvme.noacpi=1 mem_sleep_default=s2idle split_lock_detect=off
```

## Packages I install

Next to the default `core` and `extra` repositories, I enable `multilib` in
`pacman.conf` before installing. Additionally, I blacklist `pam_systemd_home.so`
because I don't use `systemd-homed` and it spams the journal on any login or
auth action:

```diff

You can install the following packages right after your system comes up first
boot, or you could do it during install with `pacstrap` (it doesn't really
matter, but in any case, make sure `core`, `contrib` and `multilib` are enabled
in `/etc/pacman.conf` first):

```

### Remove if you don't want brltty

The `qemu-full` package depends on `qemu-chardev-baum` which in turn pulls in
`brltty`, a braille (virtual?) keyboard service. If you don't need that:

```shell
pacman -R qemu-chardev-baum qemu-full brltty
userdel brltty
```

### Additionally install when you want dynamic application of power management settings

You can install `tlp` to enable dynamically applying power management settings,
based on if your power connector is connected or if you're on battery.

```shell
pacman -S --needed tlp
```

### Additionally install when you want to use dracut instead of mkinitcpio

I use `dracut` on my desktop computer, because I need working LVM RAID mirrors
there. I couldn't get that to work with `mkinitcpio` based initrd.

If you want to use `dracut` instead of `mkinitcpio` to generate initrd images,
you need to install it and remove the default initrd tooling:

```shell
pacman -S --needed dracut
pacman -R mkinitcpio mkinitcpio-busybox
```

Note that there are no hooks by default for rebuilding dracut-based initrd
images, so you'd need to do that manually after `linux` kernel package updates.
For example:

```shell
# Kernel version in package contains dot, on-disk it contains dash, hence the sed.
export KERNEL_VERSION=$(pacman -Q linux | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's|\.arch|-arch|g')
cp /lib/modules/$KERNEL_VERSION/vmlinuz /boot/vmlinuz-linux
dracut --kver $KERNEL_VERSION --force /boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img
dracut --hostonly --no-hostonly-cmdline --kver $KERNEL_VERSION --force /boot/initramfs-linux.img
```

### Additionally install when you use X11 instead of Wayland and want gestures

Wayland provides working gestures on Gnome out of the box, and Wayland is the
default on Arch Linux. If, however, you have some reason to use X11 instead of
Wayland by default and you want gestures to work, you can install Touchégg:

```shell
pacman -S --needed touchegg
```

Make sure you enable the service:

```shell
systemctl enable --now touchegg
```

And also install the required Gnome [extension](https://github.com/JoseExposito/gnome-shell-extension-x11gestures).


### Additionally install on devices with fingerprint reader

Devices like the Framework Laptop 13 have a fingerprint reader. If you want to
use it, make sure to install the following packages:

```shell
pacman -S --needed libfprint fprintd
```

And make sure you enable the service:

```shell
systemctl enable --now fprintd
```

To configure the fingerprint reader, I needed to upgrade the firmware. Version
`01000320` is known to not work with Linux. In my case, I had to use an older
version of `fwupd` (version 1.9.5 to be specific) - 1.9.10 did not work, but
I've had a report recently (thanks, Jan Schoone) that `fwupd` version 1.9.13
and possibly higher, does actually work these days (your milage may vary, etc).

In any case, I followed the instructions [here](https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/updating-fingerprint-reader-firmware-on-linux-for-13th-gen-and-amd-ryzen-7040-series-laptops-HJrvxv_za)
to update to the required firmware version `01000330` to make the fingerprint
reader work with Linux. Instructions below are based on the linked document:

```shell
# First downgrade fwupd...
wget --continue https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/f/fwupd/fwupd-1.9.5-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst --output fwupd-1.9.5-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
pacman -U fwupd-1.9.5-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
# Get firmware file and install...
wget --continue https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/linux-docs/raw/main/goodix-moc-609c-v01000330.cab --output goodix-moc-609c-v01000330.cab
fwupdtool install --allow-reinstall --allow-older goodix-moc-609c-v01000330.cab
```

Note: There might be a transfer error mentioned at the end. This can be safely
ignored. Reboot and start a fresh terminal and show the device:

```shell
fwupdmgr get-devices 1e8c8470-a49c-571a-82fd-19c9fa32b8c3
```

Note: The above command sometimes times out the first time it's run. Just run it
again and you'll see some details about the fingerprint reader. Notably, the
version should now be: `01000330`. You can now enroll fingerprints.

If your fingerprint reader is working, you can continue to follow the steps
[here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fprint) to set it up for usage.

### Additionally install on devices with Intel graphics

My Framework Laptop 13 is intel-based, so I install these packages additionally:

```shell
pacman -S --needed intel-gpu-tools vulkan-intel intel-media-driver libvdpau-va-gl intel-graphics-compiler intel-compute-runtime gst-plugin-va
```

Also, from AUR, I install these, making sure their version is synced with the
above mentioned 64-bit versions, These make it possible for 32-bit apps to also
use VAAPI-based hardware acceleration:

```
lib32-intel-gmmlib
lib32-intel-media-driver
```

### Additionally install on devices with AMD graphics

If you have an AMD device instead, you might want these ones:

```shell
pacman -S --needed radeontop vulkan-radeon gst-plugin-va ollama-rocm
```

### Additionally install on devices with NVidia graphics

If you have an NVidia device instead, you might want these ones:

```shell
pacman -S --needed cuda cuda-tools ffnvcodec-headers libva-nvidia-driver nvidia-cg-toolkit nvidia-settings nvidia-utils nvidia-open-dkms nvtop opencl-nvidia openssl-1.1 gst-plugins-bad ollama-cuda opencv-cuda python-opencv-cuda
```

Note: The `openssl-1.1` package is a (missing) dependency for
`libnvidia-pkcs11.so` contained in `nvidia-utils`.

Note 2: The `opencv-cuda` and `python-opencv-cuda` packages replace the `opencv`
and `python-opencv` packages installed previously.

### Installing official sublime-text and sublime-merge packages

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) has an official Arch linux
repository for its `sublime-text` and `sublime-merge` packages. If you want to
use those, do the following (as root):

```shell
# Install and sign the sublimehq pubkey.
curl -O https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg
pacman-key --add sublimehq-pub.gpg
pacman-key --lsign-key 8A8F901A
rm sublimehq-pub.gpg

# Add sublime-text package repository to pacman.conf.
cat <<EOF >> "/etc/pacman.conf"
# Official Sublime Text and Sublime Merge repository.
[sublime-text]
SigLevel = Required DatabaseRequired TrustedOnly
Server = https://download.sublimetext.com/arch/stable/x86_64
EOF

# Update local pacman databases and install.
pacman -Syu sublime-text sublime-merge
```

The above is based on [these instructions](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/linux_repositories.html#pacman).

### Installing lib32 package equivalents (optional)

I like to install the lib32-* package equivalents of packages I installed. There
isn't an easy way to do this and it is a bit messy, but here's how I do it:

```shell
# Clean beginnings.
mkdir -p ~/Desktop
rm ~/Desktop/lib32-candidates ~/Desktop/lib32-notfound

# Append a list of possible lib32-* package names by prepending to package name.
for p in `pacman -Qq | grep -v lib32`; do echo lib32-$p >> ~/Desktop/lib32-candidates; done

# Append a list of possible lib32-* package names which consist of lib32-firstnamepart.
for p in `pacman -Qq | grep -v lib32 | cut -d- -f1 | sort -u`; do echo lib32-$p >> ~/Desktop/lib32-candidates; done

# Remove known-not-working elements and make sure the output file is sorted and unique.
cat ~/Desktop/lib32-candidates | grep -v rustup | grep -v openssl-1.1 | grep -v mesa-amber | grep -v mesa-demos | sort -u -o ~/Desktop/lib32-candidates

# Abuse pacman -S to obtain invalid package names.
pacman -S --needed `cat ~/Desktop/lib32-candidates | sort -u` 2>&1 | grep 'error: target not found' | awk '{print $5}' > ~/Desktop/lib32-notfound

# Make sure that's sorted and unique too.
sort -o ~/Desktop/lib32-notfound ~/Desktop/lib32-notfound

# Use comm to diff the lists and only feed valid package names to pacman -S.
pacman -S --needed `comm -23 ~/Desktop/lib32-candidates ~/Desktop/lib32-notfound`
```

## Service configuration

I use and customize a bunch of services on my device. So I don't forget what
I customized and why, let me document it.

### Reflector

The `reflector` service is used to create an up-to-date mirrorlist which is used
by the package manager to decide from where to install packages.

```shell
systemctl enable --now reflactor
```

### DisplayLink

The `displaylink` service is used, together with the `evdi` driver, to handle
externally connected displays, which connect through a dock or other type of
USB3 or Thunderbolt connection. Enable it as follows:

```shell
systemctl enable --now displaylink
```

Additionally, I've observed that the `displaylink` service consumes an
inordinate amount of CPU time after a suspend/resume cycle. A quick restart of
the service works around that. To do that automatically, we can create a systemd
unit file and enable it:

```shell
# Write the systemd unit file for restarting displaylink on resume:
cat <<EOF > "/etc/systemd/system/displaylink-restart.service"
[Unit]
Description=Restart DisplayLink after resume
After=suspend.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/systemctl --no-block restart displaylink.service

[Install]
WantedBy=suspend.target
EOF

# Enable and start the automatic displaylink restart service:
systemctl enable --now displaylink-restart
```

### CpuPower

The `cpupower` service reads from `/etc/default/cpupower` and configures the
default scheduler. Edit that file to set the default scheduler to `powersave` or
`performance `and then enable it:

```shell
systemctl enable --now cpupower.service
```

### Avahi

I don't want any service auto-configuring stuff on my system, especially things
like printers for example. Therefore I disable the Avahi zeroconf service:

```shell
systemctl mask avahi-daemon.service
systemctl mask avahi-daemon.socket
systemctl mask avahi-dnsconfd.service
```

Note that a side-effect of this, is that when you use something like `xsane` or
`simplescan`, you will get a password prompt dialog every time you start the
scanning tool. This is because, apparently, these tools use `avahi` somehow,
which then has to be invoked, which is then done through `polkit`, which raises
the password dialog so the `avahi` service can be started. Yeah.

### Bluetooth

Enable `bluetooth` with:

```shell
systemctl enable --now bluetooth.service
```

Bluetooth mostly just works out of the box, except for my XBox Series X|S
Wireless Game Controller. To get this to run, I use the `xpadneo-dkms` AUR
package. Additionally, I need to configure a few settings in
`/etc/bluetooth/main.conf` (add or set these settings yourself, or use `patch`
to apply the settings to your `main.conf`):

```diff

After changes, restart the service:

```shell
systemctl restart bluetooth.service
```

### GDM

Enable `gdm` with:

```shell
systemctl enable --now gdm.service
```

I prefer auto-login on some of my devices (no on laptop, yes on desktop). Add
the two lines or apply the below diff to `/etc/gdm/custom.conf` using `patch`
if you would like your user to allow GDM to automatically login (don't forget
to replace `$USER` with your user name):

```diff

 # GDM configuration storage

 # Uncomment the line below to force the login screen to use Xorg
 #WaylandEnable=false
```

Reboot for the above to take effect.

### Libvirtd

Enable `libvirtd` with:

```shell
systemctl enable --now libvirtd.service
```

I run `libvirtd` mostly stock. I do set `unix_sock_group` to `libvirt` and add
myself to the `libvirt` group. I then set `unix_sock_ro_perms`,
`unix_sock_rw_perms` and `unix_sock_admin_perms` to `0770` (Meaning, the owner
and group can read, write and execute, everybody else can do nothing).

```
unix_sock_group = "libvirt"
unix_sock_ro_perms = "0770"
unix_sock_rw_perms = "0770"
unix_sock_admin_perms = "0770"
```

You need to change this for a whole lot of files under `/etc/libvirt`. Not doing
this causes problems when connecting with your user instead of root using the
`virsh` or `virt-manager` clients. don't forget to restart the service after
changes:

```shell
systemctl restart libvirtd.service
```

Furthermore, I configure the `virt0` interface of the `default` NAT-enabled
network to have a specific IP address (10.10.11.1) and range (note: needs to
be run after starting/restarting libvirtd):

```shell
export UUID=$(uuidgen)
cat <<EOF > "/tmp/net-default.xml"
<network>
  <name>default</name>
  <uuid>$UUID</uuid>
  <forward mode='nat'>
    <nat>
      <port start='1024' end='65535'/>

### Systemd-networkd and iwd

First configure `iwd` defaults:

```shell
mkdir -p /etc/iwd
cat <<EOF > "/etc/iwd/main.conf"
[General]
RoamThreshold=-75
RoamThreshold5G=-80

[Network]
EnableIPv6=false
NameResolvingService=systemd

[Scan]
DisablePeriodicScan=true
EOF
```

If you're connecting to a wireless network, you need to first configure that
using `iwctl`, see the [iwd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd) page on the
Arch wiki.

After that, you can configure `systemd-networkd`, which comes down to placing
configuration files in `/etc/systemd/network`. Let me give three examples.

#### Setting up an ethernet device with DHCP

```shell
cat <<EOF > "/etc/systemd/network/10-ethernet.network"
[Match]
Name=eth0

[Network]
DHCP=yes
EOF
```

#### Setting up a bridge device with DHCP

Create the physical device bind config:

```shell
cat <<EOF > "/etc/systemd/network/10-bind.network"
[Match]
Name=eth0 eth1

[Network]
Bridge=bridge0

EOF
```

Create the virtual bridge device:

```shell
cat <<EOF > "/etc/systemd/network/10-bridge.netdev"
[NetDev]
Name=bridge0
Kind=bridge
MACAddress=52:41:41:46:00:0b
EOF
```

And finally, the bridge network, configured by DHCP:

```shell
cat <<EOF > "/etc/systemd/network/10-bridge.network"
[Match]
Name=bridge0

[Network]
DHCP=yes
EOF
```

#### Setting up a wireless device with DHCP

Note that you first need to configure `iwd` to authenticate and connect to your
wireless network. After that, tell `systemd-networkd` about it:

```shell
cat <<EOF > "/etc/systemd/network/10-wireless.network"
[Match]
Name=wlan0

[Network]
DHCP=yes
IgnoreCarrierLoss=10s
EOF
```

#### Enable systemd-networkd and iwd services

Enable `systemd-networkd` and `iwd `with:

```shell
systemctl enable --now iwd.service
systemctl enable --now systemd-networkd.service
systemctl disable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
```

Note that we disable the waiting service, since we want to continue booting
even if there is no network. If you would like to know more about how you can
configure `systemd-networkd`, be sure to read the
[systemd-networkd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-networkd) page on
the Arch wiki.

### OpenSSL

I did run into an issue connecting with older VPN environments related
to OpenSSL 3.x disabling various legacy encapsulation and connection modes by
default. The error you would see in such a case is:

```
Jul 31 20:26:38 FRAME openvpn[58956]: OpenSSL: error:11800071:PKCS12 routines::mac verify failure
Jul 31 20:26:38 FRAME openvpn[58956]: OpenSSL: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
Jul 31 20:26:38 FRAME openvpn[58956]: Decoding PKCS12 failed. Probably wrong password or unsupported/legacy encryption
```

Furthermore, when you are behind corporate proxies, you might also have
difficulties passing through the corporate proxy without the settings
`UnsafeLegacyRenegotiation` and `UnsafeLegacyServerConnect` (which were allowed
by default on OpenSSL 1.x).

To work-around these issues, I place a custom  `/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf`:

```shell
cp -n "/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf" "/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf.orig"
cat <<EOF > "/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf"
HOME = .
openssl_conf = openssl_init

[openssl_init]
providers = provider_sect
ssl_conf = ssl_sect

[provider_sect]
default = default_sect
legacy = legacy_sect

[default_sect]
activate = 1

[legacy_sect]
activate = 1

[ssl_sect]
system_default = system_default_sect

[system_default_sect]
Options = UnsafeLegacyRenegotiation,UnsafeLegacyServerConnect
EOF
```

Note that I would only do the above if you need to interact with some old
legacy VPN stuff, or if you're behind moron-grade SSL-terminating proxies.
{: .notice--warning}

### NFSv4

Enable `nfsv4` with:

```shell
systemctl enable --now nfsv4-server.service
```

Quick note: the above start may fail if you updated the `linux` package but did
not reboot yet, you'll see an error about a dependency failure.
{: .notice--warning}

I use NFS only on internal interfaces, specifically the `virt0` interface of
the `default` network (remember that ip address 10.10.11.1?). This allows me
to work with shared storage on other operating systems that I fool around with
on Qemu/KVM (Note that you have much better options for modern Linux systems -
there you can use `enable shared memory` and a `virtiofs` device to essentially
loop-mount a memory block device which is a directory on the host).

Since we're only doing NFSv4, and we're not interested in user/group ID mapping,
let's stop and mask a couple of RPC services first:

```shell
systemctl stop rpcbind.service
systemctl mask rpcbind.service
systemctl stop nfs-blkmap
systemctl mask nfs-blkmap
systemctl stop nfs-idmapd
systemctl mask nfs-idmapd
systemctl stop nfs-mountd
systemctl mask nfs-mountd
```

To make NFSv4 only listen on a specific interface, and to disable version 3 of
the protocol explicitly, we patch `/etc/nfs.conf` (use `patch` or add the
`host=`, `vers3=` and `vers4=` elements by hand under `[nfsd]`:

```diff
--- nfs.conf.orig       2023-07-31 21:16:20.438028044 +0300

Create an exports for /home:

```shell
cp -n "/etc/exports.d/home.exports" "/etc/exports.d/home.exports.orig"
cat <<EOF > "/etc/exports.d/home.exports"
/home   10.10.11.0/24(rw,sync,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
EOF
```

After the above changes, restart the service:

```shell
systemctl restart nfsv4-server.service
```

### Samba

Enable `smbd` and `nmbd` with:

```shell
systemctl enable --now nmb.service smb.service
```

I use Samba for the same reasons as I use NFS, that is to have shared storage
on various older virtual machines (like Windows NT 4.0). Let's create an
`smb.conf` file:

```shell
cat <<EOF > "/etc/samba/smb.conf"
[global]
   workgroup = WORKGROUP
   netbios name = $(hostname | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' | cut -d. -f1)
   server string =

   server min protocol = NT1
   ntlm auth = yes
   lanman auth = yes
   hosts allow = 10.10.11.
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.smbd
   max log size = 100
   interfaces = 10.10.11.1/24
   bind interfaces only = yes
   dns proxy = yes
   wins proxy = yes
   wins support = yes
   local master = yes
   domain master = yes
   preferred master = yes
   os level = 33

   acl allow execute always = True
   browsable = yes
   writable = yes
   valid users = %U
   create mask = 0644
   directory mask = 0755
EOF
```

After creating or changing `smb.conf`, restart the services:

```shell
systemctl restart nmb.service smb.service
```

### TLP

Enable `tlp` with:

```shell
systemctl enable --now tlp.service
```

TLP is used to manage power-saving modes of various hardware. It is usually
configured to enable power-saving when not connected to AC, and to disable it
when connected to AC. It does that for all kinds of things, like Wi-Fi, USB,
PCIe, Bluetooth, the CPU scheduler, etc.

I've made a custom TLP configuration for my Framework Laptop 13 which you can
install as follows:

```shell
cat <<EOF > "/etc/tlp.d/01-custom.conf"
CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC=powersave
CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT=powersave

CPU_BOOST_ON_AC=0
CPU_BOOST_ON_BAT=0

PCIE_ASPM_ON_BAT=powersupersave

PLATFORM_PROFILE_ON_AC=balanced
PLATFORM_PROFILE_ON_BAT=low-power

USB_ALLOWLIST=32ac:0002
USB_EXCLUDE_BTUSB=1
USB_EXCLUDE_PRINTER=0

WIFI_PWR_ON_AC=off
WIFI_PWR_ON_BAT=off

WOL_DISABLE=N
EOF
```

After the above, you need to restart the service:

```shell
systemctl restart tlp.service
```

### Cups

Enable `cups` with:

```shell
systemctl enable --now cups.socket
```

I also don't want cups via `cups-browsed` to be able to auto-add printers, so I
patch `/etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf` as follows:

```diff
--- cups-browsed.conf.default	2023-08-29 09:57:47.157250003 +0200

```

### Docker

First make sure `containerd` (a dependency for `docker`) does not load plugins
which are not relevant for this setup (these plugins cause loading errors in a
default setup like we're building - this does not break, but it does cause a
lot of regular error messages in `journalctl`):

```shell
mkdir -p /etc/containerd
cat <<EOF > "/etc/containerd/config.toml"

version = 3
disabled_plugins = ["io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.blockfile", "io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.btrfs", "io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.devmapper", "io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.erofs", "io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.zfs", "io.containerd.differ.v1.erofs", "io.containerd.tracing.processor.v1.otlp", "io.containerd.internal.v1.tracing", "io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"]
EOF
```

Enable docker with:

```shell
systemctl enable --now docker.socket
```

I use docker without any further adjustments.

### Ollama

The `ollama` service makes it possible to easily run AI models locally using
`llama-cpp`. Just like docker, this runs as a service and you use the `ollama`
command line utility to interact with it.

```shell
systemctl enable --now ollama.service
```

Remember to install `ollama-cuda` or `ollama-rocm` if you are using NVIDIA or
AMD devices respectively (see earlier chapter about that).

After the service is enabled and running, you can run a model as follows (we're
using the `deepcoder` model here as an example):

```shell
ollama run deepcoder
```

This will download the model and start an interactive prompt.


### CDemu

I  use `cdemu` and related `vhba` kernel module to emulate optical drives for
use with emulation stuff. If you'd like to run CDemu, make sure the required
modules are loaded at boot:

```shell
# Load modules at boot.
cat <<EOF > "/etc/modules-load.d/cdemu.conf"
sg
sr_mod
vhba
EOF

# Do it now too.
modprobe -a sg sr_mod vhba

```

### Enabling user services

I use the following user-level services (do as logged in user):

```shell
for u in syncthing.service wireplumber.service pipewire.socket pipewire-pulse.socket; do systemctl enable --now --user $u; done
```

## How I use AUR

All the hip young things are running `yay` these days, but I like to do it the
bare-hands way. That way I have more feeling with what's going on with AUR
packages.

### Setting up your own custom local repository

First, let's create a `custom` repository source for pacman. Note that I sign
my packages using my GnuPG key, so the following assumes that. If you don't
want to sign your own packages, you need to change the `SigLevel` setting in
`/etc/pacman.conf` for your `custom` repository and you need to tell `makepkg`
not to sign your built package.

Also note that my package build root location is specific to my needs;
feel free to change it to anything you like.

```shell
# Set package build root location.
export PKG_ROOT="$HOME/Packaging/Arch"

# Create a directory structure for Arch packaging.
mkdir -p "$PKG_ROOT"
cd "$PKG_ROOT"
install -d Build Repository 'Source Packages' Sources -o $USER

# Create a repository database.
cd "$PKG_ROOT/Repository"
repo-add -s custom.db.tar.gz

# Add entry to /etc/pacman.conf.
cat <<EOF >> "/etc/pacman.conf"
[custom]
SigLevel = Required DatabaseRequired TrustedOnly
Server = file://$PKG_ROOT/Repository
EOF

# Add your public key to pacman keychain and set trust (assuming key matches $USER).
gpg --export --armor $USER > your.key
pacman-key --add your.key
pacman-key --lsign-key $USER
rm -qf your.key


# Run update for db and files, you should see custom being referenced.
pacman -Syu
pacman -Fy

# Unset variables.
unset PKG_ROOT
```

### Configuring for package building

Now we configure `makepkg` defaults. Make sure you configure the PKG_ROOT,
GPG_PUBKEY and PACKAGER environment variables to your specific likings:

```shell
# Set package build root location, gpgpubkey-id and packager string.
export PKG_ROOT="$HOME/Packaging/Arch"
export GPG_PUBKEY='14B189C4E877C9CAEA7F99C7ED3BDDB83BDD2604'
export PACKAGER='Rubin Simons <me@rubin55.org>'

cat <<EOF > "$HOME/.makepkg.conf"
# ~/.makepkg.conf.
MAKEFLAGS="-j$(nproc)"
BUILDENV=(!distcc color !ccache check sign)
BUILDDIR="$PKG_ROOT/Build"
PKGDEST="$PKG_ROOT/Repository"
SRCDEST="$PKG_ROOT/Sources"
SRCPKGDEST="$PKG_ROOT/Source Packages"
GPGKEY="$GPG_PUBKEY"
PACKAGER="$PACKAGER"
EOF

# Unset variables.
unset PKG_ROOT GPG_PUBKEY PACKAGER
```

### Example interactions using AUR

Here are a few example interactions with package fetching, building, repository
updating and package removal to get you started:

```shell
# Set package build root location.
export PKG_ROOT="$HOME/Packaging/Arch"

# Get an AUR package.
cd "$PKG_ROOT/Build"
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/aurutils.git

# Build an AUR package.
cd aurutils
makepkg -cCs
ls ../../Repository/aurutils*

# Show information about a built package.
cd "$PKG_ROOT/Repository"
pacman -Qpi aurutils-*-any.pkg.tar.zst

# Build a source package.
cd aurutils
makepkg -cCsS
ls ../../Source\ Packages

# Update local repository (adds new packages, removes older ones).
cd "$PKG_ROOT/Repository"
repo-add -s -n -R custom.db.tar.gz *.zst

# Remove a specific AUR package from local repository
cd "$PKG_ROOT/Repository"
repo-remove -s custom.db.tar.gz aurutils
```

### AUR packages I build and install

So now to fill that `$PKG_ROOT/Build` directory with packages from AUR so we
can build some stuff and put it in our own repository:

```shell
# Set package build root location.
export PKG_ROOT="$HOME/Packaging"

# Git clone them all.
cd "$PKG_ROOT/Build"
export GITREPOS="adwaita-qt-git aic94xx-firmware akku alsa-hdspeconf amitools ares-emu aseprite ast-firmware astrojs-language-server audacious-gtk3 audacious-plugins-gtk3 aurutils battop-bin blastem-hg bluez-hcitool bottles brscan4 bun-bin bundletool cartridges-git chez-scheme claude-code clojure-lsp-bin cmake-format cmake-language-server codechecker conan crush cubeb cypher-shell dev-proxy-bin displaylink djmount dockerfile-language-server dolphin-emu-git dosbox-x-git dotnet-core-bin dotool drawio-desktop-bin dumpasn1 earthly eclipse-platform elixir-ls erlang_ls evcxr_jupyter evdi-dkms exercism figma-linux-bin flow-bin flutterup flycast-git fmt9 ghcup-hs-bin github-desktop-bin gnome-shell-extension-auto-accent-color gnome-shell-extension-dash-to-dock-git gnome-shell-extension-stealmyfocus-git gnome-shell-extension-tiling-shell-git godot-mono-git google-cloud-cli groovy-language-server-git helm-ls hydroxide ibmcloud-cli icaclient icoextract imhex infer-bin jdk25-graalvm-bin jdk25-openj9-bin jdtls jetbrains-toolbox kddockwidgets-qt6-git kotlin-lsp-bin kubelogin lagrange lemminx lib32-gperftools lib32-intel-gmmlib lib32-intel-media-driver libbacktrace-git libchdr-git librashader libretro-beetle-cygne-git libretro-beetle-lynx-git libretro-beetle-ngp-git libretro-beetle-pcfx-git libretro-beetle-saturn-git libretro-bluemsx-git libretro-dosbox-pure-git libretro-lrps2-git libretro-swanstation-git libretro-uae-git libspng-git libwireplumber-4.0-compat license-wtfpl logisim-evolution-bin m64py marksman-git marsdev-git mednaffe mei-amt-check-git metals mkinitcpio-firmware mongodb-bin mongosh-bin moonlight-qt-git ms-sys ncurses5-compat-libs neo4j-community-bin neovim-symlinks nestopia netcoredbg networkmanager-iwd nvidia-patch-git ocenaudio-bin omnisharp-roslyn-bin openai-codex opencode openmsx openshift-client-bin openshift-developer-bin openshift-pipelines-bin openvpn-update-systemd-resolved pandoc-bin papirus-folders passmark-performancetest-bin patool pcsx2-git pcsx-redux-git pegasus-frontend-git perlnavigator plutosvg plutovg postman-bin powercap powershell-bin pragmatapro-fonts protonplus protontricks-git ps3-disc-dumper-bin pupdate-bin pvsneslib-git pwvucontrol python-dataclasses-json python-fvs python-m3u8 python-machine68k python-mpegdash python-opentype-feature-freezer python-orjson-git python-patch-ng python-pathvalidate python-pluginbase python-pyqtdarktheme-fork python-pysdl2 python-python-ffmpeg python-steamgriddb python-tidalapi python-uuid7 python-vdf qt5-gamepad rabtap rapidyaml rcu-bin regionset rpcs3-git ruby-backport ruby-e2mmap ruby-jaro_winkler ruby-jekyll-include-cache ruby-jekyll-redirect-from ruby-jekyll-sitemap ruby-just-the-docs ruby-reverse_markdown ruby-solargraph ruby-yard-activesupport-concern ruby-yard-solargraph rusty-psn-bin ryujinx sameboy sbom-tool-bin scala-dotty sedutil shellcheck-bin sigtop-git skyscraper-git slack-desktop snd-hdspe-dkms-git soapui softhsm-git stc-syncthing-git sunshine-git svelte-language-server-git swift-bin tidal-dl-ng tidal-hifi-bin tla-toolbox townsemu-git ttf-b612 ttf-ms-win11 ungoogled-chromium-bin upd72020x-fw v4l-utils-git vacuum vala-language-server vasm visual-studio-code-bin vkbasalt-cli vlink vtsls wd719x-firmware winetricks-git xcursor-dmz xdg-terminal-exec-git xpadneo-dkms yaml-language-server-git y-cruncher zeal-git"

## Final thoughts

After you've done (most of) the above, a `reboot` is in order; the system should
come up cleanly, without errors or stalls.

I've be been using this setup for the last month and it has been pretty great.
I get really good battery life, The fan almost never comes on, sleep and resume
work reliably, bluetooth works with mouse, gamepad and headphones, Libvirt has
been amazing with a bunch of interesting virtual machines (Guix, Windows NT,
RHEL6 with Softimage).

I hope to be using this machine and operating system for a long time!
